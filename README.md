I encourage you to take a moment to think about the [Problem With Putting All the World's Code in GitHub](https://www.wired.com/2015/06/problem-putting-worlds-code-github/). Then perhaps you would like to look into [the many other alternatives](https://alternativeto.net/software/github/)!

[P.S. You can find my recent open source projects on Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/talon)
