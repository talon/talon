# Hello, friend.

I encourage you to take a moment to think about the [Problem With Putting All the World's Code in GitHub](https://www.wired.com/2015/06/problem-putting-worlds-code-github/). Then perhaps you would like to look into [Sourcehut](https://sr.ht/) or [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/) or the many other [alternatives to GitHub](https://alternativeto.net/software/github/)! Thank you for coming to my TEDTalk.
